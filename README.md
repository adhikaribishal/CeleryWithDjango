A tutorial to setup the asynchronous task in the django server using celery with redis/kafka as Queue managers or brokers for the celery tasks.
Look in [celery_django_redis](https://github.com/lmkr1409/CeleryWithDjango/tree/celery_django_redis) branch for redis as task broker and in [celery_django_kafka](https://github.com/lmkr1409/CeleryWithDjango/tree/celery_django_kafka) for kafka as task broker.
